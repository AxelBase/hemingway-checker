Open the web app in any modern browser—desktop or mobile—and begin analyzing text immediately.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">The main interface features a large text input area. Start by typing directly or pasting content from your clipboard. As soon as text appears, analysis begins automatically with no need to click &quot;analyze.&quot;</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">Uploading Files</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">For existing files, use the upload feature. Supported formats include plain text (.txt) and Markdown (.md). The tool parses the content while preserving formatting for accurate sentence detection.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Markdown support is particularly useful for bloggers and technical writers. Headings, lists, and code blocks are handled intelligently—analysis focuses on prose paragraphs.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">Viewing Results</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Once text is loaded, results appear in two places: interactive highlights overlay the input and a summary panel on the side or below on mobile.</p> <ul class="svelte-2zslb9"><li class="svelte-2zslb9">Color-coded highlights for complex sentences, passive voice, adverbs, and more</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">Clickable tooltips with explanations and suggestions</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">Summary statistics including word count, grade levels, and issue breakdown</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">Instant updates with every change</li></ul> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Highlights use intuitive colors. Very complex sentences appear in red, complex in yellow, passive voice in blue, adverbs in purple. Click any highlight for detailed feedback.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Navigation is fully keyboard-accessible. Tab through controls, use arrow keys in the text area, and activate exports via shortcuts.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">For longer texts up to 10,000 words, performance remains smooth thanks to background processing.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">Exporting and Clearing</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Export your results anytime. Choose annotated HTML to preserve highlights, PDF for sharing, PNG for quick screenshots, or JSON for programmatic use.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">To start fresh, use the &quot;New Analysis&quot; button or simply delete all text.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">The mobile experience is optimized with touch-friendly controls and adaptive layouts.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Experiment freely: analyze famous speeches, news articles, or your own drafts. Compare before-and-after versions after applying suggestions.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Privacy remains paramount—nothing is stored or transmitted. Close the tab and everything disappears.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">No learning curve required. Within minutes, you&#39;ll gain insights into your writing habits and start making clearer, more impactful prose.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-2zslb9">Practice regularly to develop a stronger sense of clear writing.</p></article>`;return{c(){a=r("meta"),o=r("meta"),p=r("meta"),c=r("meta"),d=r("meta"),u=r("meta"),g=A(),l=r("div"),l.innerHTML=b,this.h()},l(n){const t=k("svelte-nlxlmj",document.head);a=i(t,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),o=i(t,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),p=i(t,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),c=i(t,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),d=i(t,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),u=i(t,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),t.forEach(s),g=T(n),l=i(n,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),_(l)!=="svelte-jow634"&&(l.innerHTML=b),this.h()},h(){document.title="Getting Started with Text Analysis | Clear Writing Blog",e(a,"name","description"),e(a,"content","A step-by-step guide to pasting text, uploading files, and viewing instant feedback in the client-side readability checker."),e(o,"property","og:title"),e(o,"content","Getting Started with Text Analysis | Clear Writing Blog"),e(p,"property","og:description"),e(p,"content","A step-by-step guide to pasting text, uploading files, and viewing instant feedback in the client-side readability checker."),e(c,"property","og:url"),e(c,"content",y+"/blog/posts/post3"),e(d,"property","og:type"),e(d,"content","article"),e(u,"name","twitter:card"),e(u,"content","summary_large_image"),e(l,"class","container fade-in post-layout svelte-2zslb9")},m(n,t){h(document.head,a),h(document.head,o),h(document.head,p),h(document.head,c),h(document.head,d),h(document.head,u),v(n,g,t),v(n,l,t)},p:m,i:m,o:m,d(n){n&&(s(g),s(l)),s(a),s(o),s(p),s(c),s(d),s(u)}}}class G extends z{constructor(a){super(),w(this,a,null,S,x,{})}}export{G as component,P as universal};
