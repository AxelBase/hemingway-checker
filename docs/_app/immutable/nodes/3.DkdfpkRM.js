      At AxelLab, we believe privacy is not a feature—<em>it&#39;s a principle</em>. The Hemingway-Style Readability Checker is built on a stateless, client-side architecture that ensures your data remains entirely yours. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Your content never leaves your browser.
    </p><br/> <p><strong>Stateless by Design</strong><br/>
      This utility operates without accounts, cookies, or server-side processing. Every analysis is performed locally, and every result is generated in real time within your device. <em>No logs, no tracking, no external dependencies</em>. This stateless model eliminates risk and reinforces user autonomy.
    </p><br/> <p><strong>Zero Data Collection</strong><br/>
      We do not collect or retain any personally identifiable information (PII). There are no analytics scripts, no behavioral profiling, and no third-party integrations. Your writing, usage patterns, and device data are never accessed or stored by us.
    </p><br/> <p><strong>Transparency and Reproducibility</strong><br/>
      All readability scoring is based on deterministic, rule-based formulas such as <em>Flesch-Kincaid</em>, <em>Gunning Fog</em>, and <em>ARI</em>. These methods are fully documented and reproducible, ensuring that users understand exactly how their content is evaluated.
    </p><br/> <p><strong>Accessibility and Compliance</strong><br/>
      We prioritize inclusive design. The interface supports keyboard navigation, screen readers, and high-contrast themes. Our stateless architecture aligns with global privacy standards including GDPR, CCPA, and POPIA, without requiring formal consent mechanisms—because we never process personal data.
    </p><br/> <p><strong>Why This Matters</strong><br/>
      In an era of opaque AI models and invasive cloud services, our tool offers a principled alternative. It’s built for writers, educators, editors, and compliance professionals who value clarity, control, and privacy. <em>No surveillance. No compromise.</em></p>`,o,i,n;return{c(){e=p("div"),a=p("div"),a.innerHTML=m,c=k(),r=p("div"),r.innerHTML=h,this.h()},l(t){e=u(t,"DIV",{class:!0});var s=C(e);a=u(s,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(a)!=="svelte-16e3h68"&&(a.innerHTML=m),c=P(s),r=u(s,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(r)!=="svelte-198ik8n"&&(r.innerHTML=h),s.forEach(v),this.h()},h(){l(a,"id","privacy"),l(a,"class","text-center text-slate-300 p-10 text-lg"),l(r,"class","w-full max-w-3xl px-4 py-6 text-slate-300 text-md italic"),l(e,"class","w-full flex flex-col items-center gap-6")},m(t,s){I(t,e,s),d(e,a),d(e,c),d(e,r),n=!0},p:_,i(t){n||(t&&T(()=>{n&&(i&&i.end(1),o=A(r,H,{y:30,duration:500}),o.start())}),n=!0)},o(t){o&&o.invalidate(),t&&(i=w(r,D,{duration:300})),n=!1},d(t){t&&v(e),t&&i&&i.end()}}}class W extends g{constructor(e){super(),b(this,e,null,L,x,{})}}export{W as component};
