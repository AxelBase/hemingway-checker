The Client-Side Readability Checker flags passive constructions instantly, encouraging stronger, more direct prose.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Passive voice occurs when the subject receives the action rather than performing it. The ball was kicked becomes active as The player kicked the ball. The difference in energy is immediate.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">The tool highlights passive sentences in blue, making them stand out against the text. Click any highlight for an explanation and a suggested active rewrite.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">How Passive Voice Is Detected</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Detection uses reliable linguistic patterns. Common signs include forms of to be combined with a past participle, often followed by by to indicate the actor.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Examples include is written, was seen, has been completed, or will be delivered. The tool catches these across tenses while avoiding false positives in legitimate uses.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">When Passive Voice Is Acceptable</h2> <ul class="svelte-2zslb9"><li class="svelte-2zslb9">When the actor is unknown or unimportant</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">When emphasis belongs on the receiver</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">In scientific writing to focus on results</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">For variety in sentence structure</li></ul> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Most general writing, however, benefits from active voice. It creates vigor, clarity, and accountability. Readers connect more easily with subjects that act.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Passive voice also lengthens sentences unnecessarily. The report was reviewed by the team becomes The team reviewed the report—shorter and stronger.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">Tips for Switching to Active</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Identify the true actor in the sentence. Move that actor to the subject position. Use a strong verb that conveys precise action.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Ask who or what performs the action. Make that entity the subject. Eliminate unnecessary forms of to be whenever possible.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Watch for zombie verbs like was conducted or is performed. Replace them with direct verbs: conducted becomes performed by someone specific.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">The tool updates highlights as you edit. Turn a passive sentence active and watch the blue marker vanish—a clear signal of improvement.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Reducing passive voice transforms timid writing into confident communication. Ideas gain force. Readers stay engaged.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Active voice isn&#39;t about aggression—it&#39;s about clarity and responsibility. Good writers own their statements.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">With practice, spotting passive constructions becomes instinctive. The tool accelerates that learning curve.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-2zslb9">Write actively.
