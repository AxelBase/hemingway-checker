The Client-Side Readability Checker offers multiple export formats, all generated entirely in your browser with full privacy.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Four options cover common needs: annotated HTML, PDF documents, PNG images, and structured JSON data. Each preserves different aspects of the analysis.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Exports happen instantly—no servers involved. Your text and highlights remain on your device throughout the process.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">Available Export Formats</h2> <ul class="svelte-2zslb9"><li class="svelte-2zslb9">HTML: Fully styled with color-coded highlights preserved</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">PDF: Professional layout suitable for printing or sharing</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">PNG: Visual snapshot of the current view</li> <li class="svelte-2zslb9">JSON: Structured data for developers or further processing</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">Annotated HTML Export</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">The HTML option creates a complete webpage with your original text and all interactive-style highlights intact. Colors, tooltips, and formatting match the live analyzer exactly.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Use this for archiving drafts with feedback or sharing detailed reviews with collaborators. The file opens in any browser without dependencies.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">PDF for Professional Sharing</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">PDF exports produce clean, printable documents. Highlights appear as colored backgrounds or underlines, with the summary panel included as a header or footer.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Ideal for formal reports, editing passes, or submitting revised work with evidence of improvements.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">PNG for Quick Visuals</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">The PNG capture saves the current screen as an image. Perfect for quick social media posts, presentations, or embedding in notes.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Scroll position and zoom level affect the capture, allowing focus on specific sections.</p> <h2 class="svelte-2zslb9">JSON for Developers</h2> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">JSON export provides structured output: full text, sentence array, readability scores, and detailed issue lists. Developers can integrate results into workflows or build custom visualizations.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">All exports include timestamps and basic metadata. File names suggest content for easy organization.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Privacy remains absolute—nothing leaves your browser. Even temporary processing happens locally.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Combine exports for comprehensive records: HTML for review, PDF for archive, JSON for automation.</p> <p class="svelte-2zslb9">Exporting closes the loop on analysis. Turn insights into actionable, shareable artifacts while maintaining complete control over your writing.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-2zslb9">Capture clarity. Share progress confidently.</p></article>`;return{c(){a=n("meta"),i=n("meta"),c=n("meta"),p=n("meta"),d=n("meta"),u=n("meta"),v=E(),l=n("div"),l.innerHTML=g,this.h()},l(r){const t=T("svelte-1edltt5",document.head);a=o(t,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),i=o(t,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),c=o(t,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),p=o(t,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),d=o(t,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),u=o(t,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),t.forEach(s),v=P(r),l=o(r,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),_(l)!=="svelte-bpe7q9"&&(l.innerHTML=g),this.h()},h(){document.title="Exporting Results and Reports | Clear Writing Blog",e(a,"name","description"),e(a,"content","Options for saving annotated text as HTML, PDF, PNG, or JSON while keeping everything client-side in the readability checker."),e(i,"property","og:title"),e(i,"content","Exporting Results and Reports | Clear Writing Blog"),e(c,"property","og:description"),e(c,"content","Options for saving annotated text as HTML, PDF, PNG, or JSON while keeping everything client-side in the readability checker."),e(p,"property","og:url"),e(p,"content",f+"/blog/posts/post7"),e(d,"property","og:type"),e(d,"content","article"),e(u,"name","twitter:card"),e(u,"content","summary_large_image"),e(l,"class","container fade-in post-layout svelte-2zslb9")},m(r,t){h(document.head,a),h(document.head,i),h(document.head,c),h(document.head,p),h(document.head,d),h(document.head,u),b(r,v,t),b(r,l,t)},p:m,i:m,o:m,d(r){r&&(s(v),s(l)),s(a),s(i),s(c),s(p),s(d),s(u)}}}class D extends z{constructor(a){super(),w(this,a,null,S,x,{})}}export{D as component,F as universal};
